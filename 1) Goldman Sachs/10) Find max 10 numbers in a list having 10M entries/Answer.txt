It can be solved in a single traversal i.e. O(n) Time complexity.
APPROACH: Imagine the question as to find the max number from 10M entries : You would maintain a max int variable while iterating towards all the numbers.
Now, let's say we need to find max 2 numbers, then it can be done by maintaining 2 int variables and just adding one more if condition from above approach.
Finally for finding 10 numbers you can take int max[] = new int[10] and maintain 10 if conditions while iterating.
